## Problem 1

**Problem 1.**  
Express the modulo operation on real numbers using only the standard arithmetic operations  
(addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and the absolute value function.  
Then, determine the derivative of the resulting expression.

### Tasks:

1. **Modulo 2 expression**  
   Derive an explicit expression corresponding to the modulo 2 operation  
   using only absolute value and arithmetic.  
   Prove that this expression agrees with the standard modulo 2 operation for all integers.

2. **Generalization to modulo n**  
   Prove that the modulo `n` operation can be represented using a finite number of absolute value functions.  
   Try to predict the minimum number of absolute values needed in general.

3. **Constructive implementation**  
   Construct an expression or an algorithm that represents `x mod n` using absolute values.  
   You may optionally submit a pull request with a working implementation.

4. **Visualization and non-integer behavior**  
   Investigate the behavior of the expression outside the integers,  
   and consider its differentiability.  
   You are welcome to propose or implement a viewer or plotting tool via pull request.
